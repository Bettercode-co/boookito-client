## Description
This project was created in 2021 and is open source. Using this source, you can create an online library management website. Currently, this service is available in the [boookito](https://boookito.ir) domain for Amirkabir Arak University.
You can localize this template for your region.
Of course, this project needs an admin management panel and a back-end that you can [email](mailto:m789219@gmail.com) and receive the back-end of this project privately.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
